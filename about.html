        <div class="bio">first off, THANK YOU for supporting me enough to even be reading this — you guys mean the world to me. 

          this business is my baby — dreamt up + started in madcap coffee on a rainy saturday in may. I grew up with a camera in hand so the idea of turning this passion into a career had always lingered in the back of my mind. maybe it was the iced oatmilk latte talking that morning, but something told me to take a risk and try something I’ve always wanted to do. so here we are — not even two weeks in and I can genuinely say I’m having the time of my life. meeting new faces, wandering around cities + beaches + fields, navigating a whole new world of photo ideas and editing possibilities. but the best part? getting to know YOU ALL — and your goofy, raw, intimate, loud, quiet, crazy, beautiful stories. There’s something so special about witnessing the most important days of your lives, seeing you squish up next to your soulmate, helping seniors embrace new confidence of adulthood, watching kids run wild and free, seeing soon to be moms beam down at their cute lil bumps, watching you all simply be you — all while trying to preserve those memories through a lens, hoping to create something resembling the beauty I witnessed firsthand. I consider it a great honor to tell your stories, and I aspire to do so in the most genuine + golden way. 
          
          now for what you truly came here for — some fun facts about the girl behind the lens. I’m the biggest beach bum you’ll ever meet, I want looots of babies someday, I can whip up some mean vegan food, I’m super passionate about holistic health + nutrition, and I married the best + hottest human alive — i’m not even biased that’s just the facts. my husband clay also coded this entire website by hand and deserves major kudos for that. if you ask nicely he might be wiling to tag along to your shoot for some drone footage + MAYBE super8 films someday soon :)
          
          thank you thank you thank you for being here. couples, families, seniors, moms, grands, you name it — i’d love to get to know you.
